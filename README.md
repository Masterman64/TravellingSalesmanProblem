# TravellingSalesmanProblem
This was an assignment for the Artifical Intelligence Special Topics class for the 2023 Summer semester at Sam Houston State University. In it, the user choses towns to visit and the distance between each town, and chooses between the Iterative-Deepening Search, Breadth-First Search, and Depth-First Search algorithms to determine the optimal path.
